hyperflow-dsl
=============

A DSL for creating workflows for https://github.com/dice-cyfronet/hyperflow

See https://github.com/wojtasskorcz/hyperflow-dsl/blob/master/src/main/scala/hdsl/parser/HdslParser.scala for the DSL's grammar specification. More extensive documentation will probably not be provided, because the project is not active currently. On request, a PDF copy of a Master Thesis based on this project can be provided which describes in more detail the design and use cases of the DSL.
