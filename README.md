hyperflow-dsl
=============

A DSL for creating workflows for https://github.com/dice-cyfronet/hyperflow

**Disclaimer**: this project is not actively maintained since 2015. Please be aware that the author's Scala skills at that time were rather limited. This project is archived here as a showcase.

See `/src/main/scala/hdsl/parser/HdslParser.scala` for the DSL's grammar specification. More extensive documentation will probably not be provided, because the project is not active currently. On request, a PDF copy of a Master Thesis based on this project can be provided which describes in more detail the design and use cases of the DSL. For examples of workflows created using the DSL please see `/src/test/resources`.
